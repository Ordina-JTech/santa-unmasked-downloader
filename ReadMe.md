## Introduction
The Santa unmasked workshop needs some dependencies (+/- 600MB). Use this project to download the dependencies before the workshop starts. This can take some time. 

1. Use ```mvn clean install``` to make sure that the maven dependencies are downloaded.
2. Use you favorite ide (or commandline) to run the Downloader.java class. This will make sure that VGG16 network and MNIST data is downloaded.
